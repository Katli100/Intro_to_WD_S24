Making sure you have a good workflow is very important when 
creating wireframes as it makes creating wireframes effecient, 
and ensures there are interactions you are not forgetting. I
remember when I created my first wireframe, I realized that I 
did not account for space for a mobile user that has a nudge on 
the top of screen. Collaboration is very important for getting 
feedback and changing things early before production.
